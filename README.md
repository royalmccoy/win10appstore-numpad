# win10appstore-numpad
My primary laptop runs windows 10 and does not have a number pad. This makes inputting special characters (accents and math symbols most frequently) much more difficult. In apps that don't support their own system [notepad >:(] you basically have to do the cut/paste. I'd like to program an app for the Windows 10 store that lets me map custom keys on my keyboard to be received as NUMPAD input (when enabled) so that this is not so hard... At the time of this writing, I am just beginning my coding education, and have no idea where to start with this project (December 2017)
